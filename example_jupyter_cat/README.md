# Jupyter Cat

This is a Jupyterlab version of Google Cat.

This example contains scripts that show how Jupyterlab can be used as a development environment for RPA. Scripts are implemented for Ubuntu 19.04, but should be easy to adapt for other Linux distributions. Windows versions are yet to come.

## prepare_development_environment.sh

After following the instructions in Prepare Ubuntu 19.04 for Jupyterlab this script will create a Python 3 virtual environment and install all packages that are required for the RPA task execution or Jupyterlab development.
